# TriggerLab

This application allows you to test and debug Webhooks and HTTP requests using unique (random) URLs. You can customize the response code, `content-type` HTTP header, response content and set some delay for the HTTP responses. The main idea is viewed [here](https://github.com/fredsted/webhook.site).
